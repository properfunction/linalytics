# tft-coaching
TFT app that connects players of all skill levels and allows for insights from the community aimed at improving gameplay fundamentals.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind, EJS, Passport, Cloudinary, Bcrypt

Using Node and Express to create a server that connects to MongoDB database via Mongoose. 
Adding authorisation using strategies from Passport, with enhanced security via password hashing from bcrypt. 
Opting for cloudinary middleware to provide an easy and optimised storage solution for media.
Rendering will be handled by EJS templating engine, which easily handles HTML and CSS styling from Tailwind

## Optimizations

Following an MVC model using JavaScript, there is an option to further optimise with React

## Lessons Learned:

Having a good mockup and being able to identify what is needed in your Schema really helps when programming the functionality and implementing the application logic
